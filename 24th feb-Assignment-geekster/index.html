                <p id="moon">Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording
                    light,
                    either
                    electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material
                    such as
                    photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography),
                    and
                    business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes,
                    hobby,
                    and mass communication.[1]



                    Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on
                    the
                    light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor,
                    this
                    produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a
                    digital
                    image
                    file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible
                    latent
                    image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive,
                    depending on
                    the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is
                    traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print,
                    either
                    by
                    using an enlarger or by contact printing.</p>
